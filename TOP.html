    <h2>Foundations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Introduction</h3></li>
        <p>
            There was a <i>lot</i> to learn here for me. My brain was overloaded with information. Thankfully, I didn't have a job at the time so despite my brain being exhausted learning this halfway through the day, I could just keep pushing myself.<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                <li>Back-end: Java, Python, Ruby</li>
                <li>Full-Stack: ALL of the above</li>

            <h4>The Internet</h4>
            <p>
                I have a newwork with a router -> router connects to modem -> modem runs through telephone lines, turning network information into information mangeable by telephone infrastructure (and vice versa)
                <br>
                ISP = company that manages special routers than can access other ISPs routers
                <br>
                computer -> router -> modem -> telephone line -> ISP (mine) -> ISP (other) -> telephone line -> their modem -> their router -> their computer with info (server)
                <br>
                server = special computer connected directly to the internet used to store webpages

        <p>
            Not much to say here, for installations themsevles, it set me up well. I learned a lot of command line basics though.

                    -lhs readable sizes plus sort by size<br>
                -lt reverse sort - can be used with others
