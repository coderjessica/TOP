<h1>Everything I've Learned from <a href="https://theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a></h1></header>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            There was a <i>lot</i> to learn here for me. My brain was overloaded with information. Thankfully, I didn't have a job at the time so despite my brain being exhausted learning this halfway through the day, I could just keep pushing myself.<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                <li>Back-end: Java, Python, Ruby</li>
                <li>Full-Stack: ALL of the above</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
            <h3>The Internet</h3>
            <p>
                I have a newwork with a router -> router connects to modem -> modem runs through telephone lines, turning network information into information mangeable by telephone infrastructure (and vice versa)
                <br>
                ISP = company that manages special routers than can access other ISPs routers
                <br>
                computer -> router -> modem -> telephone line -> ISP (mine) -> ISP (other) -> telephone line -> their modem -> their router -> their computer with info (server)
                <br>
                server = special computer connected directly to the internet used to store webpages
            </p>

        <h2>Installations</h2>
        <p>
            Not much to say here but for installations themsevles, it set me up well. I learned a lot of command line basics though.
        </p>
        <h3>Command Line Basics:</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>$pwd where am I</li>

                -lh readable sizes<br>
                    -lhs readable sizes plus sort by size<br>
                -lt reverse sort - can be used with others

                -s symbolic link (symlink)
